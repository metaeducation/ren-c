        This file defines a "Port Scheme" for reading and writing data via
        the HTTP protocol.  The protocol is built on top of a Generic
        "connection" which can be plain TCP or be layered with the transport
        layer security scheme (TLS), in which case the HTTP acts as HTTPS.

        The original code circa 2012 in the open source release of R3-Alpha
        attempted to be asynchronous, and had some rather convoluted logic
        pertaining to events and and wakeups.  Due to various weaknesses of
        that model it never enabled any interesting asynchronous scenarios,
        and was really just an extremely-difficult-to-debug way of writing
        synchronous reads and writes.  In 2021 it is being simplified:

        https://forum.rebol.info/t/1733

        So the goal is to stylize the protocol code synchronously, with the
        idea of doing something similar to Go's "goroutines" in order to
        achieve parallelism.  But for now the limitation is that the reads and
        writes are synchronous, with the benefit of increasing the clarity
        of the code.

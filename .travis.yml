#
# .travis.yml contains YAML-formatted (http://www.yaml.org/) instructions
# for building Rebol for continuous integration via Travis CI:
#
# http://docs.travis-ci.com/
#
# Several platforms and compilers are used to try and give a breadth of
# testing for portability.  Also if the build process is successful with no
# errors, then the resulting binaries are deployed to an S3 instance:
#
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/s3/
#
# Those files are indexed by a Rebol script to generate an HTML download page.
# The generation is currently run manually when interesting new versions are
# available, and published here:
#
# http://metaeducation.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
#

# Note: "The suggested syntax for YAML files is to use 2 spaces for
# indentation, but YAML will follow whatever indentation system that the
# individual file uses."
#
# http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2777534
#
# For this file, follow the convention that list items (started with dash)
# are indented two spaces from their container key, and then all members of
# the list are at the same indentation level of two spaces after that dash.
#
# DO use [[ ]] in conditions, so `>` is greater (not redirect) and $X is "$X"
# http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031
#
# DON'T put variable *values* in quotes that don't need it (FOO=x not FOO="x")
# DO put variable *substitutions* in quotes ("$X" not $X), EXCEPT in [[ ]]
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/131766/
#
# DON'T use curly braces on variables unless needed ("$FOO" not "${FOO}")
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/4910
#
# DO use = in [[ ]] conditions for lexical comparison (= not ==)
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/16110
#
# DON'T put space between x=y when doing variable assignments (you can't! :-/)
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/297217
#
# DON'T use superfluous semicolons at end of lines of shell commands:
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/7507242/
#
# DO use $(...) vs. `...` for shell execution (save `...` for code comments)
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/9406350/
#
# "$foo 123" -> substitues foo contents to get `foocontents 123`
# '$foo 123' -> takes it literally, so you get `$foo 123`
#
# `xargs` may be a useful command when dealing with the shell:
# http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xargs.1.html  (e.g. `... | xargs cat`)
#

# When doing cross-compilation, the build products can't be examined using the
# normal tools on the host.  The tools in $CROSS_DIR need to be used, e.g.:
#
#    if [[ $OS_ID = 0.3.1 ]]; then  # x86-win32
#        "${CROSS_PREFIX}objdump" -t lib/i386/alloca86.o | grep alloca
#    elif [[ $OS_ID = 0.3.40 ]]; then
#        "${CROSS_PREFIX}objdump" -t lib/x86_64/alloca86_64.o | grep alloca
#    fi

# In our case, we'd like to fetch a Rebol binary to use as the "r3-make".
# Its job is to process C and Rebol sources to automatically generate some
# header files and embedded Rebol code bundles used in bootstrap, as well as
# to generate makefiles.
#
# !!! Originally, the Rebol that was fetched was the last r3-alpha that was
# published on rebol.com, to ensure that it could still be used for bootstrap.
# Conversion of the build in mid-2017 to using %rebmake.r meant that only a
# semi-recent Ren-C could be used to run the build prep steps.  There will not
# be an attempt to go back to building with R3-Alpha, though a more purposeful
# stable build should be picked at some point to replace the ad-hoc choice
# which wound up in the make dir.  The shim which is required to upgrade that
# older Ren-C is now rather "thick", and slows the build down significantly.

## .gitignore strategy
#
# Only keep ren-c project specific file exclusions in .gitignore
#
# For files created by...
#
#   * Editors (for eg. Vim, Eclipse, etc)
#   * Machines (Windows, Linux, OSX, etc)
#   * or any artifacts of your development environment
#
# then please keep these exclusions in a global .gitignore file which
# should not be commited into the ren-c repo.
#
# For more info please see "Create a global .gitignore" at:
#
#     https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/
#
# Our recommended advice is to use a .gitignore_global file described
# in link.
#
# Here is an example .gitignore_global used on OS X (Mac):
#
#      ## Mac stuff
#      .DS_Store
#
#      ## Vim stuff
#      *.un~
#      *.swp
#
# This is kept in the users home directory:  ~/.gitignore_global
#


# It is possible to build Rebol in any directory via an "out-of-source build"
# https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/365460/
# But by default %make.r chooses the %build/ subdirectory.
#
# It can be convenient if you are doing multiple builds of the same Rebol
# codebase for different platforms to put them in separate build
# directories (such as build-win32 or build-macos-x64) so they don't erase
# each other's state
#
build/*
build-*/*

# The prebuilt directory is also ignored (see README.md in the directory)
# Edits to the README.md should be noticed, however.
#
prebuilt/*
!prebuilt/README.md

# The tests directory generates .log files with the prefix r_2
# (Historical reasoning for why the "2" is that so long as it was in alpha,
# the version of Rebol was not formally bumped to 3, and would be done on
# release...or so the rumor goes.)

# Some extensions are part of the main repository, while others are not.
# Right now if you want to build a non-main-repository extension you git clone
# it into the extensions directory.  You should be able to build an extension
# from the network without cloning it locally, and if you wish to clone it
# locally it should probably go in a different directory.  But for now let's
# just ignore any extensions that aren't part of the main repo if you happen
# to have cloned them into %extensions/

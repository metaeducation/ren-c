; MATCH was an early function for trying a REFRAMER-like capacity for
; building a frame of an invocation, stealing its first argument, and then
; returning that in the case of a match.  But now that REFRAMER exists,
; the idea of having that feature implemented in core functions has fallen
; from favor.
;
; Here we see the demo done with a reframer to make MATCH+ as a proof of
; concept of how it would be done if you wanted it.

; Note: This file is testing the error trapping functions.
;
; Annotations like #rescue are used here to act as a reminder not to remove
; the rescues from the test (thinking you could just use the usual error-id
; testing mechanism of test).  e.g. I don't want someone to change:
;
;    #rescue (
;       e: rescue [1 / 0]
;       e.id = 'zero-divide
;    )
;
; Into the abbreviated testing like we'd usually use:
;
;    ~zero-divide~ !! (1 / 0)
;

#rescue (
    e: rescue [1 / 0]
    e.id = 'zero-divide
)
#rescue (
    e: rescue [e: 1 / 0]
    e.id = 'zero-divide

;
; The PANIC function in Ren-C is a usermode function that attempts to give
; a richer experience than the `DO MAKE ERROR!` behavior in R3-Alpha.


; PANIC may be used on its own.  If it didn't consider this a legitimate
; way of panicking, it would have to panic with some error anyway.
; This is convenient for throwaway code.
[
    ~unknown-error~ !! (panic)
    ~unknown-error~ !! (case [null [x] null [y] panic])
]


; A simple PANIC with a string message has no error ID
;
(e: sys.util/recover [panic "hello"], (e.id = null) and (e.message = "hello"))


; PANIC instead with a WORD! will make the error have that ID
;
(e: sys.util/recover [panic 'some-error-id], e.id = 'some-error-id)


; PANIC can be given a :BLAME parameter.  It gives a more informative message,
; even when no text is provided.

;; Source analysis tests.  These check the source code for adherence to
;; coding conventions (naming, indentation, column width, etc.)  These
;; tests may evolve further into enforcing rules about the call graph
;; and other statically-checkable aspects.
;;
;; At the moment, there are some failures of these tests.  They will be
;; addressed in an ongoing fashion as the source is brought in line
;; with the automated checking.

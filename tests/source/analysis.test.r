;
; Source analysis tests.  These check the source code for adherence to
; coding conventions (naming, indentation, column width, etc.)  These
; tests may evolve further into enforcing rules about the call graph
; and other statically-checkable aspects.
;
; At the moment, there are some failures of these tests.  They will be
; addressed in an ongoing fashion as the source is brought in line
; with the automated checking.

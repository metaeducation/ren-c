; GET-GROUP! tests
;
; Initially `:(x)` was a synonym for `get x`, but this was replaced with the
; idea of doing the same thing as (x) in the evaluator...freeing up shades
; of distinction in dialecting.

(get-group? first [:(a b c)])
(get-tuple? first [:(a b c).d])

(chain! = type of first [:(a b c)])
(chain! = type of first [:(a b c).d])

; !!! What was a GET-GROUP! is now a CHAIN!, and a meaning has not yet been
; decided on--if there will be any--for the regular evaluator.

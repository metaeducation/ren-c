; LIT-WORD! is no longer an independent data type, as all quoted values
; are now of type QUOTED!.  So &LIT-WORD? is actually a "type constraint"
; of singly-quoted words (&QUOTED-WORD? may be a better name)
;

(lit-word? first ['a])
(not lit-word? 1)
(switch:type first ['a] [lit-word?/ [okay]])

; lit-words are active
(
    a-value: first ['a]
    equal? to word! unquote a-value eval reduce [a-value]

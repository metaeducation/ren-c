; ONE takes the place of some instances of R3-Alpha SKIP in UPARSE.  While
; others are taken by NEXT...which is better for suggesting you don't want
; the value, or if you want a synthesized product you want a position.  This
; lines up better with SKIP and NEXT in normal series evaluation, where SKIP
; is not arity-0.
;
; Also addresses the fact that `x: skip` seems fishy...if something is
; being "skipped over" then why would it yield a value?
;
; There is no "THE" combinator in UPARSE, and so @ is used as a synonym for
; ONE.  This ties in a bit with its uses of "match an item literally here"
; e.g. @var, but when the var is missing it makes some sense to match with
; basically whatever is there.  (However this is probably not a great idea
; to make @(^void) a synonym for @, but rather to opt out of the match...)

; MAXMATCH was a thought experiment proposed as a way of illustrating that
; there can be multiple ideas for the "rollback" semantics of certain
; constructs--so there has to be a way for the combinator to decide vs.
; just assuming a simple rule.  We try to offer the best of both worlds
; with a simple automatic rollback mechanism that can be overridden if
; the combinator expresses an intent to be directly involved.
;
; It's not intended to be particularly useful--it doesn't have an obvious
; right answer if the matches are both equal length.  But it's the kind of
; combinator that a user could write and use off the cuff.


; In the first variation of the combinator we will use the default
; "rollback" mechanism.  This happens when you do not mention the
; pending list of accrued items at all.

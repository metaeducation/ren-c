; GET-GROUP!s will evaluate code to produce a rule to splice as if it had
; been written in that spot.  If a WORD! is used as a rule, it cannot be
; variadic.  So this is legal:
;
;    >> parse [a a a] [inline (if 1 = 1 ['veto]) | some 'a]
;    == a
;
; But this is not legal:
;
;    >> parse [a a a] [inline (if 1 = 1 ['some]) 'a]

; It is a particularly powerful facility--though unlike COMPOSE it will run
; the code in the group every time it is encountered in the PARSE, so can

; !!! Partial rule splicing doesn't work with GET-GROUP! being a combinator
; under the constraints of the current design...this would mean it would be
; effectively a "variadic combinator", or would be sending some signal up
; to the BLOCK! combinator about what it wanted to splice.  Punt on it for now,
; as being able to redefine the behavior of GET-GROUP! via a combinator is
; much more compelling.

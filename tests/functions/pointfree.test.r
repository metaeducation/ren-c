; Pointfree was removed from the bootstrap, and is instead being moved to a
; test file.
;
; The lower-level pointfree function separates out the action it takes, but
; the higher level one uses a block.  Specialize out the action, and then
; overwrite it in the enclosure with an action taken out of the block.

[(
    ; POINTFREE* is the lower-level version that takes FRAME! and BLOCK! of
    ; just the arguments.
    ;
    ; NOTE: Variadics are not handled at this time.
    ;
    ; 1. If what gets passed in is something like append/ then we don't want
    ;    to be modifying that directly.  We make a copy.  This *should* be
    ;    done with just `copy frame`, but that is residually a lightweight
    ;    way to make a Details identity that resists hijacking.
    ;
    ; 2. If we did a GET of a PATH! it comes back as a partially specialized
    ;    function, where the refinements are reported as normal args at the
    ;    right spot in the evaluation order.  (e.g. GET $APPEND:DUP returns a
    ;    function where DUP is a plain WORD! parameter in the third spot).
    ;
    ; 3. If the user does (pointfree append/ [_ [d e]]) then the blank signals
    ;    an unspecialized slot.  So that would be like writing:
    ;
    ;        specialize append/ [value: [d e]]  ; leave series unspecialized

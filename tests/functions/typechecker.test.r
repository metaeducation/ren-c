; The typechecker and matcher are functions that need to have their
; implementations merged and streamlined.
;
; It's not entirely clear what circumstances will require a pure
; LOGIC! result like what the typechecker returns (e.g. would FIND
; allow you to use a MATCHER instead of a TYPECHECKER, and consider
; any non-null (and non-void) output to be a "branch trigger"?
;
; Similar questions exist for type constraint functions used in
; type specs.

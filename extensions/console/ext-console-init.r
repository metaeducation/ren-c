        This is a rich, skinnable console for Rebol--where basically all the
        implementation is itself userspace Rebol code.  Documentation for the
        skinning hooks exist here:

        https://github.com/r3n/reboldocs/wiki/User-and-Console

        The HOST-CONSOLE Rebol function is invoked in a loop by a small C
        main function (see %main/main.c).  HOST-CONSOLE does not itself run
        arbitrary user code with DO.  That would be risky, because it actually
        is not allowed to panic or be canceled with Ctrl-C.  Instead, it just
        gathers input...and produces a block which is returned to C to
        actually execute.

        This design allows the console to sandbox potentially misbehaving
        skin code, and fall back on a default skin if there is a problem.
        It also makes sure that that user code doesn't see the console's
        implementation in its backtrace.

        The default INPUT-HOOK uses READ-LINE from the Stdio extension.  That
        implementation of READ-LINE is based on reading keystrokes one at a
        time on Windows and Linux (vs. using APIs that read entire lines at
        once), so it could theoretically offer more flexibility such as tab
        completion--but hooks to expose that haven't been developed.

        === FORM ERROR IF RAISED ===

        ; The console knows the difference between an error returned as
        ; a result, and a panic.  It's worth thinking about how to present
        ; this nuance in the display...but for now we just form it, because
        ; it looks ugly to show the molded antiform object.

        if error? ^v [
            print form unanti ^v
            return ~
        ]

        === GHOSTS! ===

        if ghost? ^v [
            print unspaced [result _ "~,~" _ _ ";" _ "anti (ghost)"]
            return ~
        ]

        === UNPACK FIRST VALUE IN "PACKS" ===

        ; Block antiforms represent multiple returns.  Only the first output
        ; is printed--but with a comment saying that it
        ; was in a pack.  This hints the user to do a ^META on the value to
        ; see the complete pack.
        ;
        ; 0-length packs (~[]~ antiform, a.k.a. "void") mold like antiforms.

        if pack? ^v [
            v: unanti ^v
            if 0 = length of v [  ; mold like a regular antiform, for now

            ^v: unlift first v  ; items in pack are LIFT'ed
        ]

        === PRINT NO OUTPUT FOR TRASH! (antiform RUNE!) ===

        ; By default, we've decided that some state(s) need to not display in
        ; the console, to suppress output from things like HELP or PRINT,
        ; because it's noisy to have `== xxx` produced in that case.
        ;
        ; (Of course, a console customization could be done which displayed
        ; all results...but the default should look somewhat streamlined.)
        ;
        ; Whatever doesn't display will be a "lie" in some sense.  The two
        ; competing lies are VOID (a.k.a. empty block antiform, result of
        ; things like `eval []`) and TRASH (a.k.a. the antiforms of RUNE!).
        ;
        ; The decision has flipped many times, but trash wins:
        ;
        ; https://forum.rebol.info/t/console-treatment-of-void-vs-trash/2045
        ;
        ; TRASH? can hold arbitrary message content as an antiform RUNE!, but
        ; the most succinct state of trash is antiform space (TRIPWIRE, whose
        ; quasiform looks like a single tilde `~`).  Right now we don't show
        ; any trash, regardless of whether it contains a label or not.

        if trash? ^v [
            return ~
        ]

        === ANTIFORMS (^META v parameter means they are quasiforms) ===

        if antiform? ^v [
            ;
            ; Antiforms don't technically have "a representation", but the
            ; historical console behavior is to add a comment annotation.
            ;
            ;     >> eval [~something~]
            ;     == ~something~  ; anti
            ;
            ; Antiforms are evaluative products only, so you won't see the
            ; annotation for anything you picked out of a block:
            ;
            ;     >> first [~something~]
            ;     == ~something~
            ;
            v: lift ^v  ; turn antiform into quasiform
            print unspaced [result _ mold v _ _ ";" _ "anti"]
            return ~

    ;   https://forum.rebol.info/t/1071
    ;
    ; 1. The WRAP* operation will collect the top-level SET-WORD declarations
    ;    and add them to the passed in context, and then run the block bound
    ;    into that context.  This allows:
    ;
    ;        >> x: 10

    ;
    ;    See: https://forum.rebol.info/t/2128/6

    ;    from the block it's passed, and then run it.  But with the lower
    ;    level code working with modules, it's less clear--virtually binding
    ;    the module via a "USE!" won't get the inheritance, and if we make
    ;    the module the binding literally then that would have to override
    ;    whatever binding was on the block.  Leave it open for now, as these

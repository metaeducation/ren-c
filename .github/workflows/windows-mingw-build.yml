#=============================================================================#
#
# This uses a Linux container and the "Minimalist GNU for Windows" to cross
# compile executables for Windows.
#
# The main reason this exists in addition to the MSVC-based non-cross-compiling
# process is because the original CI process on Travis did not have containers
# running windows.  So this was the only way to build Windows executables.
#
# Keeping it working has several advantages:
#
# * It tests compilation in a somewhat "alien" environment, which increases the
#   likelihood that the code is being kept in shape such that it could be
#   compiled for other unusual platforms.
#
# * If the cross-compilation with MinGW works, then odds are pretty good that
#   the non-cross-compiling MinGW that runs on native Windows will work too.
#
# * Some open source libraries do not have configuration environments tailored
#   to the MSVC toolchain.  It may come up that someone wants to use such a
#   library on Windows, and it can be easier to do that with MinGW than to
#   try and figure out how to get it working with the MSVC toolset.
#
# There are limits to how much work is worth it to keep this working, but it
# has been historically not much cost so it's allowed to stay.

# but rather just used as a proof-of-concept of compilation flexibility.
#
# ...ALSO, since no Filesystem/Network/Process extension is in the MinGW
# build, this demonstrates what happens when you run without those things,
# and makes sure it still basically works.

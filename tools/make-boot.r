     * when no longer in use.  But a pre-determined set of internings are
     * assigned 16-bit integer "SYM" compile-time-constants, to be used in
     * switch() for efficiency in the core.

     * (Note that since the built-in symbols are collected from scanning
     * the source, the IDs will change if the source changes.  This means
     * any change affecting symbols will require recompiling everything.)
     *
     * Built-in symbols are quickly allocated in a batch at boot time, loaded
     * from a set of compressed strings in the boot block.  The symbols are
     * never garbage collected, because they need to stick around to hold on
     * to their embedded ID so they are recognized by the switches.
     *
     * There's also a feature of reserving numbers for symbols that aren't
     * built in, but that any extension which uses them agrees to use the
     * same number and provide it at registration time.  See Register_Symbol().
     *
     * Datatypes are given symbol numbers at the start of the list, so that
     * their SYM_XXX values will be identical to their TYPE_XXX values.
     *
     * The file %words.r contains a list of spellings that are given ID
     * numbers recognized by the core.
     *
     * Errors used in the core are identified by the symbol number of their
     * ID (there are no fixed-integer values for these errors as R3-Alpha
     * tried to do with RE_XXX numbers, which fluctuated and were of dubious
     * benefit when symbol comparison is available).
     *
     * Note: Any interning that *does not have* a compile-time constant
     * assigned to it will have a symbol ID of 0.  See Option(SymId) for how
     * potential bugs like `Word_Id(a) == Word_Id(b)` are mitigated
     * by preventing such comparisons.

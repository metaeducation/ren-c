    description: --[
        R3-Alpha's bootstrap process depended on the GNU Make Tool, with a
        makefile generated from minor adjustments to a boilerplate copy of
        the makefile text.  As needs grew, a second build process arose
        which used CMake...which was also capable of creating files for
        various IDEs, such as Visual Studio.

        %rebmake.r arose to try and reconcile these two build processes, and
        eliminate dependency on an external make tool completely.  It can
        generate makefiles for GNU Make or Microsoft's Nmake, or just conduct
        a full build by invoking compiler processes and command lines itself.

        In theory this code is abstracted such that it could be used by other
        projects.  In practice, it is tailored to the specific needs and
        settings of the Rebol project.

    warning: --[
        This code is not representative of modern practices, because it has
        to run in a very old bootstrap executable.  It is also very much a
        hodgepodge just to keep things running.  While efforts have been made
        so the bootstrap executable "emulates" the look of modern Ren-C, it's
        there are many compromises.  So generally speaking, don't look here
        for exemplary code.

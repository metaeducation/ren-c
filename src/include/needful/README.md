# Needful: The library that does nothing in your C programs (and you NEED it!)

These files are being factored out of Ren-C as as an independent MIT-licensed
library called "Needful".  Its goal is to help people to use C++ compilers to
verify properties of C codebases...while still being able to compile that code
with a C compiler.

Migration to a separate repository with its own test suite and documentation is
a work in progress.

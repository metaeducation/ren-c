**
** Needful is a header-only library, containing various definitions for C
** constructs that can behave in more "interesting" ways when built as C++.
**
** To help convince you of Needful's "light" nature in C builds, it's written
** with all the C #defines up front in this one file--you can see how simple
** they (mostly) are.  Adding it to a C project is a low-impact proposition...
** you only have to add *one* file to your project, and it can be built in
** either C or C++ mode, standalone.
**
** But if you `#define NEEDFUL_CPP_ENHANCEMENTS 1` (and have the additional
** files implementing the enhancements in Needful's directory) then they'll be
** included at the end of the file.  This will #undef the simple definitions,
** and #define them as more complex ones.  This is what gives the powerful
** compile-time checks.  You can enlist in the Needful project separately in
** your continuous integration or whatever build system you have, and the extra
** files will only be included when you ask to build with the extra features.
**
** It helps document your code even if you just use the one `needful.h` file.
** But when you do build with the C++ enhancements, you get powerful checks,
** with no extra tools needed but the compiler you already have.
**
****[[ NOTES ]]***************************************************************
**
** A. When built in C language mode, the Result() and Option() types rely on
**    the polymorphic construction from 0 for enums, pointers and integers.
**    Though legal, GCC and Clang give warnings about such conversions if they
**    produce a pointer -AND- come from a compound expression:
**
**     SomeEnum Make_Enum(...) { return 0; }  // no warning
**     Something* Make_Pointer(...) { return 0; }  // no warning
**
**     SomeEnum Make_Enum(...) { return (..., 0); }  // no warning
**     Something* Make_Pointer(...) { return (..., 0); }  // GCC + Clang warn
**
**   If you want to use Result(Something*) in C builds, `return fail (...);`
**   requires the compound construction from 0, and Option(Something*) may
**   need this if you conditionally produce `none`.  Needful disables the
**   warning for convenience, so you don't need `-Wno-int-conversion`.  But
**   don't worry: the C++ enhanced build will catch any mistakes.
**
**   (C++ is more strict than C about what can be converted from 0, and would
**   have errors--not warnings.  Tools like `nocast` are used to work around
**   this if just using the skeletal file, with more targeted behavior
**   in the enhanced definitions.)

/***[[ Option(T): EXPLICITLY DISENGAGE-ABLE TYPE ]]***************************
**
** Option() provides targeted functionality in the vein of Rust's `Option`
** and C++'s `std::optional`:
**
**     Option(char*) abc = "abc";
**     Option(char*) xxx = none;  // nullptr is synonym for pointer types
**
**     if (abc)
**        printf("abc is truthy, so `unwrap abc` is safe!\n")
**
**     if (! xxx)
**        printf("XXX is falsey, so don't `unwrap xxx`...\n")
**
**     char* s1 = abc;                  // ! compile-time error !
**     Option(char*) s2 = abc;          // legal
**
**     char* s3 = unwrap xxx;           // ! runtime error (if debug build) !
**     char* s4 = opt xxx;              // gets nullptr out
**
** It leverages the natural boolean coercibility of the contained type.  So
** you can use it with things like pointers, integers or enums...anywhere the
** C build can treat 0 as a "falsey" state.
**
** While a no-op in C, in C++ builds a wrapper class can give compile-time
** enforcement that you don't pass an Option() to a function that expects the
** wrapped type without first unwrapping it.  You can also choose to add a
** runtime check that `unwrap` never happens on a zero-containing Option().

/****[[ SCOPE_GUARD: PROTECT FROM UNSAFE MACRO USAGES ]]**********************
**
** Macros that expand into multiple statements can be dangerous if used in
** a context where a single statement is expected.  This is typically handled
** in C/C++ with a `do { ... } while (0)` construct, but trickier macros may
** not be able to do their work inside a block.
**
** This SCOPE_GUARD is a trick which makes an unused variable with a unique
** name, that will cause a compile error if used in something like the branch
** slot of an `if` statement.
**
** 1. There is an issue in macro expansions that was seen in Clang 15, which
**    makes the scope guard more aggressive than it needs to be (e.g. not
**    allowing use in a switch case statement without braces).

/****[[ Result(T): MULTIPLEXED ERROR AND RETURN RESULT ]]*********************
**
** These macros provide a C/C++-compatible mechanism for propagating and
** handling errors in a style similar to Rust's `Result<T, E>`, all without
** requiring exceptions or setjmp/longjmp in C++ builds.
**
** Instead, the multiplexing of an Error with the return value type is done
** with a global (or more generally, thread-local) error state.
**
** A key feature is the ability to propagate errors automatically.  So
** instead of having to laboriously write things like:
**
**     Error* Some_Func(int* result, int x) {
**         if (x < 304)
**             return fail ("the value is too small");
**         *result = x + 20;
**         return nullptr;  // no error
**     }
**
**     Error* Other_Func(int* result) {
**         int y;
**         Error* e = Some_Func(&y, 1000);
**         if (e)
**             return e;
**         assert(y == 1020);
**
**         int z;
**         Error* e = Some_Func(&z, 10);
**         if (e)
**             return e;
**         printf("this would never be reached...");
**
**         *result = z;
**         return nullptr;  // no error
**     }
**
** You can write it like this:
**
**     Result(int) Some_Func(int x) {
**         if (x < 304)
**             return fail ("the value is too small");
**         return x + 20;
**     }
**
**     Result(int) Other_Func(void) {
**         trap (
**           int y = Some_Func(1000)
**         );
**         assert(y == 1020);
**
**         trap (
**           int z = Some_Func(10)
**         );
**         printf("this would never be reached...");
**
**         return z;
**     }
**
** Also of particular note is the syntax for catching "exceptional" cases
** (though again, not C++ exceptions and not longjmps).  This syntax looks
** particularly natural due to clever use of a `for` loop to get a scope:
**
**     int result = Some_Func(10 + 20) except (Error* e) {
**         // e scoped to the block
**         printf("caught an error: %s\n", e->message);
**     }
**
** So the macros enable a shockingly literate style of programming that is
** portable between C and C++, avoids exceptions and longjmps, and provides
** clear, explicit error handling and propagation.
**
*****[[ NOTES ]]**************************************************************
**
** A. As long as a datatype can be constructed from 0 within the rules of the
**    C standard (pointers, enums, integers) it can be used with Result().
**    You may have to disable compiler warnings related to the enum or
**    pointer casts of 0, but it is legal so you should be able to do it.
**
**    In C builds with GCC/Clang, the flag you want is `-Wno-int-conversion`
**
**    (The C++ build doesn't require disabling the warnings because it uses
**    a "Result0Struct" object to more precisely capture the intent.)
**
** B. In order for these macros to work, they need to be able to test and
**    clear the global error state...as well as a flag as to whether the
**    failure is divergent or not.  Hence you have to define:
**
**        ErrorType* Needful_Test_And_Clear_Failure()
**        ErrorType* Needful_Get_Failure()
**        void Needful_Set_Failure(ErrorType* error)
**        void Needful_Panic_Abruptly()
**        void Needful_Assert_Not_Failing()  // avoids assert() dependency
**
**    These can be functions or macros with the same signature.  They should
**    use thread-local state if they're to work in multi-threaded code.

/****[[ Sink(T): INDICATE FUNCTION OUTPUT PARAMETERS ]]***********************
**
** The idea behind a Sink() is to be able to mark on a function's interface
** when a function argument passed by pointer is intended as an output.
** This has benefits of documentation, and can also be given some teeth by
** scrambling the memory that the pointer points at (so long as it isn't an
** "in-out" parameter).
**
** But there's another feature implemented here, which is *covariance* for
** input parameters, and "contravariance" for output parameters.  This only
** matters if you're applying inheritance selectively to datatypes in C++
** builds to add checking to your C codebase.  See the implementation of
** the contravariance in %needful-sinks.h for more details.
**
** 1. Historical note: NeedfulNeed() might seem like a funny name, but the
**    library's name was actually inspired by the `Need` wrapper type, so
**    it falls out that the "scoped" name for it would look a bit strange.

/****[[ ensure(T,expr): CHEAP COMPILE-TIME MACRO TYPE ASSURANCE ]]************
**
** Macros do not have type checking, which makes them dangerous.  So it is
** considered better to use inline functions if something is conceptually
** a function.
**
** But while inline functions are promoted as being "zero cost" compared to
** an equivalent macro, this isn't always the case.  In debug builds, an
** inline function is typically not inlined--and will slow down the runtime
** in what are potentially very hot paths.
**
** There's also a problem in C with const propagation.  A choice must be
** made about whether inline functions will take const or non-const pointers.
** So unlike a macro, it can't "do the right thing" in terms of behaving
** as const for a const input, and mutable for a mutable input.
**
** Thirdly, inline functions don't have the same powers as macros...so if you
** are writing a macro and want to have type checking for some portion of it,
** you have to split your definition so that it's part macro, part inline
** function.  This can lead code to being less clear.
**
** ensure() is a simple tool whose C++ override addresses all three points:
**
**      int* ptr = ...;
**      void *p = ensure(int*, ptr);  // succeeds at compile-time
**
**      char* ptr = ...;
**      void *p = ensure(int*, ptr);   // fails at compile-time
**
** It does not cost anything at runtime--even in debug builds--because it
** doesn't rely on a function template in the C++ override.
**
** 1. The Rigid form of Ensure will error if you try to pass a const pointer
**    in when a non-const pointer was specified.  But the lenient form will
**    match as a const pointer, and pass through the const pointer.  This
**    turns out to be more useful in most cases than enforcing mutability,
**    and it also is briefer to read at the callsite.

/****[[ cast(): VISIBLE (AND HOOKABLE!) ERGONOMIC CASTS ]]********************
**
** These macros for casting provide *easier-to-spot* variants of parentheses
** cast (so you can see where the casts are in otherwise-parenthesized
** expressions).  They also help document at the callsite what the semantic
** purpose of the cast is.
**
** The definitions in C are trivial--they just act like a parenthesized cast.
** But there are enhanced features when you build as C++11 or higher, where
** the casts can implement their narrower policies and validation logic.
** In release builds, the casts have zero overhead.
**
** Also, the casts are designed to be "hookable" so that customized checks
** can be added in C++ builds.  These can be compile-time checks (to limit
** what types can be cast to what)...as well as runtime checks in your debug
** builds, that can actually validate that the data being cast is legal for
** the target type.  This even works for casts of raw pointers to types!
**
** 1. As with all needful macros, we don't force short names on clients.
**    You may have a `cast()` function or variable in your codebase, and if
**    that's more important than having the macro be named cast() you can
**    define it some other way.  But a short name like cast() or coerce()
**    is certainly recommended to get the maximum benefit.
**
** 2. You don't always want to run validation hooks when casting that make
**    sure the data is valid for the target type.  For example, if you are
**    casting a fresh malloc(), the data won't be initialized yet.  It may
**    also be that performance critical code wants to avoid the overhead
**    of validation--even in debug builds.
**
** 3. By default the casts are "lenient" in terms of constness, in the sense
**    that if you try to cast a const pointer to a non-const pointer, it
**    won't error...but will pass through a const version of the target type.
**    This makes casts briefer, e.g. you don't have to be redundant:
**
**       void Some_Func(const Base* base) {
**           const Derived* derived = cast(const Derived*, base);
**              // why not just Derived*? --^
**       }
**
**    If you just do `cast(Derived*, base)` the C build would just do a cast
**    to the mutable Derived*, but you'd get the const correctness in the C++
**    build with less typing.  In any case, the "rigid" casts don't do this
**    passthru, so you get an error omitting const in such cases.

** the C++ build would be forced to do any reinterpret_cast<> through a
** function template that can't be constexpr.  Optimizers would inline it,
** but it would still be a function call in debug builds.

** It makes the source more communicative for these weird casts to stand out

/****[[ v_cast(): VA_LIST CAST ]]*********************************************
**
** The va_list type is compiler magic (const va_list* may be a compiler
** error) and the standard doesn't even guarantee you can pass a `va_list*`
** through a `void*` and cast it back to `va_list*`!  But in practice, that
** works on most platforms, as long as you are only passing the `va_list`
** object by address and not copying or dereferencing it in a way that
** violates its ABI requirements.
**
** If possible, the C++ build will stop you from using other casts on a
** va_list* and force you to use this narrow cast that only allows mutable
** va_list* to be cast to void*, and vice-versa.  If you don't want to
** include <stdarg.h> to do the checks, see NEEDFUL_DONT_INCLUDE_STDARG_H.

/****[[ downcast and upcast(): "INHERITANCE" CASTING ]]***********************
**
** One of Needful's features is to facilitate using type hiearchies in C.
** You can frame your data types as having inheritance in the sense that
** derived types can be passed to functions taking base types but not vice
** versa.  C++ checks it, but C does not.
**
** But also, upcast() is more generally applied for "implicit" casts, e.g.
** any cast that would have worked as a normal assignment.
**
** 1. In the C build, performing an upcast() will give you a void pointer,
**    which you can pass anywhere.  In the C++ build, it produces a temporary
**    object to hold the expression result that is willing to convert itself
**    anywhere the expression could have been used...but that temporary
**    object disallows dereferencing, so you can't write:
**
**         upcast(Get_Some_Derived_Class())->base_member
**
**    This leads to consistent behavior in C and C+ builds, since the C
**    void pointer result wouldn't allow such dereferencing either.

**
** The parentheses-cast is the only cast in C, so it is maximally permissive.

** any standards-compliant compiler must let you disable that warning.
**
** If you are in a situation where the Needful casts are not working for you,
** the "xtreme" cast is a way to fall back on the C cast while still being
** more visible as a cast in a code than parentheses.
**
** 1. The choice of the name "xtreme" is because `x_cast()` seems like the
**    right name for it, whereas `c_cast()` would suggest something with

*****[[ NOTES ]]**************************************************************
**
** 1. Because `cast` has a fair likelihood of being defined as the name of a
**    function or variable in C codebases, Needful does not force a definition
**    of `cast`.  But in an ideal situation, you could adapt your codebase
**    such that cast() can be defined, and defined as h_cast().
**
**    It's also potentially the case that you might want to start it out as
**    meaning u_cast()...especially if gradually adding Needful to existing
**    code.  You could start by turning all the old (T)(V) casts into cast()
**    defined as u_cast()...and redefine it as h_cast() after a process over
**    the span of time, having figured out which needed to be other casts.
*/

/***[[ attempt, until, whilst: ENHANCED LOOP MACROS ]]************************
**
** This is a fun trick that brings a little bit of the ATTEMPT and UNTIL loop
** functionality from Ren-C into C.
**
** The `attempt` macro is a loop that runs its body just once, and then
** evaluates the `then` or `else` clause (if present):
**
**     attempt {
**         ... some code ...
**         if (condition) { break; }  // exit attempt, run "else" clause
**         if (condition) { continue; }  // exit attempt, run "then" clause
**         if (condition) { again; }  // jump to attempt and run it again
**         ... more code ...
**     }
**     then {  // optional then clause
**        ... code to run if no break happened ...
**     }
**     else {  // optional else clause (must have then clause to use else)
**        ... code to run if a break happened ...
**     }
**
** It doesn't do anything you couldn't do with defining some goto labels.
** But if you have B breaks and C continues and A agains, you don't have to
** type the label names ((B + 1) + (C + 1) + (A + 1)) times.  And you don't
** have to worry about coming up with the names for those labels!
**
** Since `while` is taken, the corresponding enhanced version of while that
** supports `then` and `else` clauses is called `whilst`.  But for a better

/****[[ ZERO TYPE (RETURN-ABLE `void` SURROGATE) ]]***************************
**
** When using wrappers like Result(T) to do their magic, void can't be used
** as something that is able to be constructed from 0 when trying to do
** something like `return fail (...);`  Result(void) would just be void in
** a C build, and you can't pass any parameter to the `return` of a function
** that has a void return type (not even void itself, as `return void;`)
**
** Proposals to change this have been rejected, e.g. this from 2015:
**
**   https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0146r0.html
**
** So instead of Result(void) we use Result(Zero).  This is like what Rust
** would call the "unit type" (which they write as `()`).
**
** To make it work in C, it's just an enum with a single zero value.  But
** the C++ version is more complex.
**
** 1. The name "Zero" is chosen because "Nothing" is too close to "None"
**    which is being used for the `Option()` type's disengaged state.
**
** 2. There is no way the C++ enhancements can statically assert at
**    compile-time that a Zero is only being constructed from the 0 literal.
**    Because of this, you have to say `return zero` instead of `return 0`
**    when using the Zero type to pass the C++ static analysis.

** carrying information about something that *might* be true:
**
**     int i = Get_Integer(...);  // i may be < 0
**
** Even the C no-op version of `possibly()` lets you break it out so the
** visual flow is better, and less likely to overflow a line:
**
**     int i = Get_Integer(...);
**     possibly(i < 0);
**
** But the C++ overload of STATIC_ASSERT_DECLTYPE_BOOL() allows it to make
** sure your expression is well-formed at compile-time.  It still does nothing
** at run-time, but causes a compile-time error if the variable is renamed and
** not updated, etc.  `impossible()` is a similar trick, but for documenting
** things that are invariants, but not worth paying for a runtime assert.
**
** `unnecessary()` and `dont()` aren't boolean-constrained, and help document
** lines of code that are not needed (or would actively break things), while
** ensuring the expressions are up-to-date as valid for the compiler.
**
** `heeded()` marks things that look stray or like they have no effect, but
** their side-effect is intentional (perhaps only in debug builds, that check
** for what they did).

** Uppercase versions, can be used in global scope (more limited abilities)

**
** If you use these words for things like variable names, you will have
** problems if they are defined as macros.  You can pick your own terms but
** these are the ones that were used in Needful's original client.
**
** These are SIMPLE ALIASES, and the parameterization is given as a comment
** for documentation purposes.  There can be big breakages when an expansion
** might produce commas inside angle brackets in C++ builds, and variadic
** forwarding doesn't always work around that.  It's cleaner and safer (and
** faster at compile time) to do it this way.
**
** 1. A quick and dirty way to write `return failed;` and not have to come
**    up with an error might be useful in some codebases.  We don't try to
**    define that here, because it's open ended as to what you'd use for
**    your error value type.
**
** 2. The lenient form of ensure() is quite useful for writing polymorphic
**    macros which are const-in => const-out and mutable-in => mutable-out.
**    This tends to be more useful than wanting to enforce that only mutable
**    pointers can be passed into a macro (the bulk of macros are reading
**    operations, anyway).  So lenient defaults to the short name `ensure()`.

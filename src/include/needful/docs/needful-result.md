# Needful Result: Bringing Rust-Style Error Handling to C/C++

## Executive Summary

The Needful Result library introduces a revolutionary approach to error handling in C and C++ that mimics Rust's powerful `Result<T, E>` type and `?` operator without requiring exceptions, `longjmp`, or breaking C compatibility. By leveraging clever macro design and optional C++ type safety, Needful enables developers to write robust, readable error-handling code that propagates failures automatically while maintaining the performance characteristics and deterministic behavior that C/C++ developers expect.

## The Problem: Error Handling Complexity in C/C++

### Traditional C Error Handling Challenges

C's traditional error handling patterns suffer from several critical issues:

**1. Verbose and Error-Prone Code**
```c
Error* Some_Func(int* result, int x) {
    if (x < 304)
        return fail("the value is too small");
    *result = x + 20;
    return nullptr;
}

Error* Other_Func(int* result) {
    int y;
    Error* e = Some_Func(&y, 1000);
    if (e) return e;  // Manual propagation
    
    int z;
    e = Some_Func(&z, 10);
    if (e) return e;  // Manual propagation again
    
    *result = z;
    return nullptr;
}
```

**2. Easy to Forget Error Checks**
Developers frequently forget to check return codes, leading to undefined behavior and security vulnerabilities.

**3. Mixed Return Values and Error Codes**
Using return values for both success data and error indicators creates ambiguity and reduces type safety.

**4. Exception Alternatives Are Problematic**
- C++ exceptions add runtime overhead and complicate control flow
- `setjmp`/`longjmp` breaks RAII and stack unwinding
- Both approaches can be unavailable in embedded or real-time systems

### C++ Exception Limitations

While C++ exceptions solve some problems, they introduce others:
- **Performance overhead**: Exception handling adds runtime costs even when no exceptions are thrown
- **All-or-nothing**: Either the entire codebase uses exceptions or none of it does
- **Embedded constraints**: Many embedded, real-time, or safety-critical systems forbid exceptions
- **C interoperability**: C code cannot participate in C++ exception handling

## The Solution: Needful Result

### Core Concept: Cooperative Error Propagation

Needful Result transforms the verbose traditional pattern into elegant, Rust-inspired syntax:

```c
Result(int) Some_Func(int x) {
    if (x < 304)
        return fail("the value is too small");
    return x + 20;
}

Result(int) Other_Func(void) {
    int y = trap(Some_Func(1000));
    assert(y == 1020);
    
    int z = trap(Some_Func(10));  // Auto-propagates on failure
    printf("this would never be reached...");
    
    return z;
}
```

### Key Features

**1. Automatic Error Propagation**
The `trap()` macro automatically propagates errors up the call stack, similar to Rust's `?` operator, eliminating boilerplate error-checking code.

**2. Elegant Exception-Style Syntax**
```c
int result = Some_Func(30) except (Error* e) {
    printf("caught an error: %s\n", e->message);
    return default_value;
}
```

**3. C/C++ Compatibility**
The same code compiles and runs correctly in both C and C++ environments, with enhanced type safety in C++ builds.

**4. Zero Runtime Overhead**
Error propagation uses thread-local state rather than exceptions or `longjmp`, maintaining deterministic performance.

**5. Compile-Time Safety**
C++ builds leverage `[[nodiscard]]` attributes and template metaprogramming to catch common errors at compile time.

## Technical Architecture

### Global Error State Management

Needful uses thread-local storage to maintain error state without breaking function signatures:

```c
ErrorType* Needful_Test_And_Clear_Failure()
ErrorType* Needful_Get_Failure()
void Needful_Set_Failure(ErrorType* error)
bool Needful_Get_Divergence()
void Needful_Force_Divergent()
```

### Cooperative vs. Divergent Errors

The system distinguishes between two types of errors:

- **Cooperative errors** (`return fail`): Normal error conditions that can be handled
- **Divergent errors** (`panic`): Critical failures that should not be caught in normal flow

### Type Safety Through C++ Templates

In C++ builds, Needful provides additional safety through:
- `ResultWrapper<T>` templates that prevent misuse
- `[[nodiscard]]` attributes that catch ignored results
- "Hot potato" extraction mechanisms that enforce proper handling

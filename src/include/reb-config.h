**  Summary: General build configuration
**  Module:  reb-config.h
**  Author:  Carl Sassenrath
**  Notes:
**      This is the first file included.  It is included by both
**      reb-host.h and sys-core.h, and all Rebol code can include
**      one (and only one) of those...based on whether the file is
**      part of the core or in the "host".
**
**      Many of the flags controlling the build (such as
**      the TO_<target> definitions) come from -DTO_<target> in the
**      compiler command-line.  These command lines are generally
**      produced automatically, based on the build that is picked
**      from %systems.r.
**
**      However, some flags require the preprocessor's help to
**      decide if they are relevant, for instance if they involve
**      detecting features of the compiler while it's running.
**      Or they may adjust a feature so narrowly that putting it
**      into the system configuration would seem unnecessary.
**
**      Over time, this file should be balanced and adjusted with
**      %systems.r in order to make the most convenient and clear
**      build process.  If there is difficulty in making a build
**      work on a system, use that as an opportunity to reflect
**      how to make this better.

/** Primary Configuration **********************************************

The primary target system is defined by:

    TO_(os-base)    - for example TO_WINDOWS or TO_LINUX
    TO_(os-name)    - for example TO_WINDOWS_X86 or TO_LINUX_X64

The default config builds an R3 HOST executable program.

To change the config, host-kit developers can define:

    REB_EXT         - build an extension module
                      * create a DLL, not a host executable
                      * do not export a host lib (OS_ lib)
                      * call r3lib via struct and macros

    REB_CORE        - build /core only, no graphics, windows, etc.

Special internal defines used by RT, not Host-Kit developers:

    REB_API         - build r3lib as API
                      * export r3lib functions
                      * build r3lib dispatch table
                      * call host lib (OS_) via struct and macros

    REB_EXE         - build r3 as a standalone executable

    REB_DEF         - special includes, symbols, and tables

// These are definitions that need to be visible to both %a-lib.c and
// "libRebol" clients.
//
// Historically, routines exported as libRebol were prefixed by "RL_"
// (Rebol Lib).  Interactions with the garbage collector were quite shaky,
// because they used their own proxy for REBVAL cells which contained raw
// pointers to series...and generally speaking, raw series pointers were
// being held in arbitrary locations in user code the GC could not find.
//
// Ren-C split this into two kinds of clients: one that can use the internal
// API, including things like PUSH_GUARD_VALUE() and SER_HEAD(), with all
// the powers and responsibility of a native in the EXE.  Then the libRebol
// clients do not know what a REBSER is, they only have REBVAL pointers...
// which are opaque, and they can't pick them apart.  This means the GC
// stays in control.
//
// Clients would use the libRebol API for simple embedding where the concerns
// are mostly easy bridging to run some Rebol code and get information back.
// The internal API is used for extensions or the authoring of "user natives"
// which are Rebol functions whose body is a compiled string of C code.
//

#include "reb-defs.h"

// This table of types used to be automatically generated by complex scripts.
// Yet the original theory of these values is that they would be kept in a
// strict order while REB_XXX values might be rearranged for other reasons.
// While the future of the RL_API is in flux, these are now just hardcoded
// as an enum for simplicity, and the tables mapping them to Rebol types are
// built by C code in RL_Init().
//
// !!! It was purposefully the case in R3-Alpha that not all internal REB_XXX
// types had corresponding RXT_XXX types.  But its not clear that all such
// cases were excluded becaues they weren't supposed to be exported...some
// may have just not been implemented.  Now that "RXIARG" is not a separate
// entity from a REBVAL, "exporting" types should be less involved. 
//
// !!! Currently these are hardcoded at their "historical" values, which
// gives a feeling of how it might come to have gaps over time if this
// parallel table which tries to stay constant is kept.  Though there's no
// code that could successfully link against the other changes to the API,
// so they could be compacted if need be.

//=//// TRAMPOLINE_FLAG_RECYCLE ///////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The recycle flag indicates a need to run the garbage collector, when
// running it synchronously could be dangerous.  This is important e.g. during
// memory allocation, which can detect crossing a memory usage boundary that
// suggests GC'ing would be good...but might be in the middle of code that is
// halfway through manipulating a managed Flex.  Recycling does not happen
// until the trampoline regains control.
//

//=//// TRAMPOLINE_FLAG_HALT //////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The halt flag requests returning to the topmost level of the evaluator,
// regardless of how deep a debug stack might be.  The trampoline will only
// react to it when the top level doesn't have LEVEL_FLAG_UNINTERRUPTIBLE set.
// Clients of the API can choose to react to interruption outside of the
// evaluator by asking for rebTestAndClearHaltRequested().
//
#define TRAMPOLINE_FLAG_HALT \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(1)


//=//// TRAMPOLINE_FLAG_DEBUG_BREAK ///////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The Debug Break request indicates a desire to enter an interactive
// debugging state.  Because the ability to manage such a state may not be
// registered by the host, this could generate an error.
//

//=//// FAKE DEBUGGING MODE FLAG //////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// While development of an interactive debugger has been out of reach for a
// long time, the system is being continually designed with the idea of
// supporting it.
//
// One of the key premises of being able to implement a stepwise debugger is
// that instead of being trapped in tight optimization loops, there is a
// continuous ability to "bounce" out to the trampoline...yielding a locus
// of control where a debugger can be put.  A good example of this is that
// evaluating a block like [1 + 2, 3 + 4] shouldn't stay nested in a single
// C stack level where it churns forward to the next expression without
// giving up control--however tempting it might be to style the code to
// optimize in a tight loop.
//
// As an attempt to have our cake and eat it too, the idea is that certain
// code is sensitive to whether a debug mode is engaged or not.  If it is not
// then it can pursue more aggressive optimizations and skip over yields.
// But if the mode is enabled, then even situations like (eval []) must yield
// to show that an empty block is there and getting stepped over...vs. just
// pretending it isn't there.
//
// Due to this debugger not existing yet, one thing we can do is to make a
// test in the RUNTIME_CHECKS build that will sporadically answer "yes, we are
// in a debugger mode".  This is done by using a deterministic modulus of
// the trampoline's tick count...which approximates random behavior while
// still giving reproducible code paths between runs.  This way the code paths
// that would be used by the debugger can be exercised, and by choosing a
// relatively sparse modulus, the performance impact is not too bad.
//
// Something to note is that if a decision is made based on being in the
// debug mode, enough memory of that decision has to be kept in order to be
// coherent...since the next time you ask if it's in debug mode the answer
// may be different.  (This is likely to be true of a real debug mode too,
// that might be switched on and off at arbitrary moments of runtime, so it's
// probably a good exercise.)
//
// Each call to In_Debug_Mode() can give its own modulus, so that if an
// operation is particularly costly a larger modulus can be used.

#define In_Debug_Mode(n)  SPORADICALLY(n)
#define In_Optimized_Mode(n)  (not SPORADICALLY(n))

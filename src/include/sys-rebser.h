//
// This contains the struct definition for the "REBSER" struct Reb_Series.
// It is a small-ish descriptor for a series (though if the amount of data
// in the series is small enough, it is embedded into the structure itself.)
//
// Every string, block, path, etc. in Rebol has a REBSER.  The implementation
// of them is reused in many places where Rebol needs a general-purpose
// dynamically growing structure.  It is also used for fixed size structures
// which would like to participate in garbage collection.
//
// The REBSER is fixed-size, and is allocated as a "node" from a memory pool.
// That pool quickly grants and releases memory ranges that are sizeof(REBSER)
// without needing to use malloc() and free() for each individual allocation.
// These nodes can also be enumerated in the pool without needing the series
// to be tracked via a linked list or other structure.  The garbage collector
// is one example of code that performs such an enumeration.
//
// A REBSER node pointer will remain valid as long as outstanding references
// to the series exist in values visible to the GC.  On the other hand, the
// series's data pointer may be freed and reallocated to respond to the needs
// of resizing.  (In the future, it may be reallocated just as an idle task
// by the GC to reclaim or optimize space.)  Hence pointers into data in a
// managed series *must not be held onto across evaluations*, without
// special protection or accomodation.
//
//=//// NOTES /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// * For the forward declarations of series subclasses, see %reb-defs.h
//
// * Because a series contains a union member that embeds a REBVAL directly,
//   `struct Reb_Value` must be fully defined before this file can compile.
//   Hence %sys-rebval.h must already be included.
//
// * For the API of operations available on REBSER types, see %sys-series.h
//
// * REBARR is a series that contains Rebol values (REBVALs).  It has many
//   concerns specific to special treatment and handling, in interaction with
//   the garbage collector as well as handling "relative vs specific" values.
//
// * Several related types (REBACT for function, REBCTX for context) are
//   actually stylized arrays.  They are laid out with special values in their
//   content (e.g. at the [0] index), or by links to other series in their
//   `->misc` field of the REBSER node.  Hence series are the basic building
//   blocks of nearly all variable-size structures in the system.

// SERIES <<HEADER>> FLAGS
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Series have two places to store bits...in the "header" and in the "info".
// The following are the SERIES_FLAG_XXX and ARRAY_FLAG_XXX etc. that are used
// in the header, while the SERIES_INFO_XXX flags will be found in the info.
//
// ** Make_Series() takes SERIES_FLAG_XXX as a parameter, so anything that
// controls series creation should be a _FLAG_ as opposed to an _INFO_! **
//
// (Other general rules might be that bits that are to be tested or set as
// a group should be in the same flag group.  Perhaps things that don't change
// for the lifetime of the series might prefer header to the info, too?
// Such things might help with caching.)
//

#define SERIES_MASK_NONE \

//=//// SERIES_FLAG_FIXED_SIZE ////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This means a series cannot be expanded or contracted.  Values within the
// series are still writable (assuming it isn't otherwise locked).
//
// !!! Is there checking in all paths?  Do series contractions check this?
//
// One important reason for ensuring a series is fixed size is to avoid
// the possibility of the data pointer being reallocated.  This allows
// code to ignore the usual rule that it is unsafe to hold a pointer to
// a value inside the series data.
//
// !!! Strictly speaking, SERIES_FLAG_NO_RELOCATE could be different
// from fixed size... if there would be a reason to reallocate besides
// changing size (such as memory compaction).  For now, just make the two
// equivalent but let the callsite distinguish the intent.

//
// Indicates the series holds a UTF-8 encoded string.
//
// !!! Currently this is only used to store ANY-WORD! symbols, which are
// read-only and cannot be indexed into, e.g. with `next 'foo`.  This is
// because UTF-8 characters are encoded at variable sizes, and the series
// indexing does not support that at this time.  However, it would be nice
// if a way could be figured out to unify ANY-STRING! with ANY-WORD! somehow
// in order to implement the "UTF-8 Everywhere" manifesto:

//
// R3-Alpha would round some memory allocation requests up to a power of 2.
// This may well not be a good idea:
//
// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3190146/
//
// But leaving it alone for the moment: there is a mechanical problem that the
// specific number of bytes requested for allocating series data is not saved.
// Only the series capacity measured in elements is known.
//
// Hence this flag is marked on the node, which is enough to recreate the
// actual number of allocator bytes to release when the series is freed.  The
// memory is accurately tracked for GC decisions, and balances back to 0 at
// program end.
//
// Note: All R3-Alpha's series had elements that were powers of 2, so this bit
// was not necessary there.

//
// Indicates that this is a series of REBVAL value cells, and suitable for
// using as the payload of an ANY-ARRAY! value.  When a series carries this
// bit, then if it's also NODE_FLAG_MANAGED the garbage collector will process
// its transitive closure to make sure all the values it contains (and the
// values its references contain) do not have series GC'd out from under them.
//
// Note: R3-Alpha used `SER_WIDE(s) == sizeof(REBVAL)` for this, but the bit
// allows series of items that aren't REBVAL, just incidentally the same size.

//
// The Reb_Series node has two pointers in it, ->link and ->misc, which are

//
// Identifies arrays in which it is legal to have void elements.  This is true
// for instance on reified C va_list()s which were being used for unevaluated
// applies (like R3-Alpha's APPLY/ONLY).  When those va_lists need to be put
// into arrays for the purposes of GC protection, they may contain voids which
// they need to track.

//
// This indicates that a context's varlist data lives on the stack.  That
// means that when the function terminates, the data will no longer be
// accessible (so SERIES_FLAG_INACCESSIBLE will be true).
//
// !!! Ultimately this flag may be unnecessary because stack-based and

//
// Note: There is a feature in PROTECT (CELL_FLAG_PROTECTED) which protects

// DO, or PARSE, or enumerations.  Even REMOVE-EACH will transition the series
// it is operating on into a HOLD state while the removal signals are being
// gathered, and apply all the removals at once before releasing the hold.
//
// It will be released when the execution is finished, which distinguishes it

//
// Indicates that the length or values cannot be modified...ever.  It has been
// locked and will never be released from that state for its lifetime, and if
// it's an array then everything referenced beneath it is also frozen.  This
// means that if a read-only copy of it is required, no copy needs to be made.
//
// (Contrast this with the temporary condition like caused by something
// like SERIES_INFO_HOLD or SERIES_INFO_PROTECTED.)

// map keys.  This approach was chosen after realizing that a lot of times,
// users don't care if something they use as a key gets locked.  So instead
// of erroring by telling them they can't use an unlocked series as a map key,
// this locks it but changes the SERIES_FLAG_FILE_LINE to implicate the
// point where the locking occurs.

// stack level popped (there's no data to lookup for words bound to it).
//
// !!! This is currently redundant with checking if a CONTEXT_INFO_STACK
// series has its `misc.f` (REBFRM) nulled out, but it means both can be
// tested at the same time with a single bit.
//
// !!! It is conceivable that there would be other cases besides frames that
// would want to expire their contents, and it's also conceivable that frames
// might want to *half* expire their contents (e.g. have a hybrid of both
// stack and dynamic values+locals).  These are potential things to look at.

//=//// FRAME_INFO_FAILED /////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// In the specific case of a frame being freed due to a failure, this mark
// is put on the context node.  What this allows is for the system to account
// for which nodes are being GC'd due to lack of a rebRelease(), as opposed
// to those being GC'd due to failure.
//
// What this means is that the system can use managed handles by default
// while still letting "rigorous" code track cases where it made use of the
// GC facility vs. doing explicit tracking.  Essentially, it permits a kind
// of valgrind/address-sanitizer way of looking at a codebase vs. just taking

// case of its letters--just that it was loaded first.  Canon forms can be
// GC'd and then delegate the job of being canon to another spelling.

// that object to make its own copy.
//
// Note: This flag did not exist in R3-Alpha, so all expansions would copy--
// even if expanding the same object by 1 item 100 times with no sharing of

// SERIES NODE ("REBSER") STRUCTURE DEFINITION
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// A REBSER node is the size of two REBVALs, and there are 3 basic layouts
// which can be overlaid inside the node:
//
//      Dynamic: [header [allocation tracking] info link misc]
//     Singular: [header [REBVAL cell] info link misc]
//      Pairing: [[REBVAL cell] [REBVAL cell]]
//
// `info` is not the start of a "Rebol Node" (REBNODE, e.g. either a REBSER or
// a REBVAL cell).  But in the singular case it is positioned right where
// the next cell after the embedded cell *would* be.  Hence the bit in the
// info corresponding to NODE_FLAG_END is set, making it conform to the
// "terminating array" pattern.  To lower the risk of this implicit terminator
// being accidentally overwritten (which would corrupt link and misc), the
// bit corresponding to NODE_FLAG_CELL is clear.
//
// Singulars have widespread applications in the system, notably the
// efficient implementation of FRAME!.  They also narrow the gap in overhead
// between COMPOSE [A (B) C] vs. REDUCE ['A B 'C] such that the memory cost
// of the array is nearly the same as just having another value in the array.
//
// Pair REBSERs are allocated from the REBSER pool instead of their own to
// help exchange a common "currency" of allocation size more efficiently.
// They are planned for use in the PAIR! and MAP! datatypes, and anticipated
// to play a crucial part in the API--allowing a persistent handle for a
// GC'able REBVAL and associated "meta" value (which can be used for
// reference counting or other tracking.)
//
// Most of the time, code does not need to be concerned about distinguishing
// Pair from the Dynamic and Singular layouts--because it already knows
// which kind it has.  Only the GC needs to be concerned when marking
// and sweeping.
//

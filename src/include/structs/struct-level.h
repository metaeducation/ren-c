// Levels are allocated out of their own memory pool.
//
//=//// NOTES /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// * Due to contention with the usermode datatype FRAME!, stack levels of the
//   trampoline are called "Levels" as opposed to "Frames".  This is actually
//   a good distinction, as levels are much more broad than function frames.
//
// * Because lowercase "L" looks too much like a number 1, the shorthand for
//   level variables is uppercase L.
//


// !!! A Level* answers that it is a node, and a cell.  This is questionable
// and should be reviewed now that many features no longer depend on it.

#define LEVEL_FLAG_0_IS_TRUE FLAG_LEFT_BIT(0)  // IS a node
STATIC_ASSERT(LEVEL_FLAG_0_IS_TRUE == BASE_FLAG_BASE);

#define LEVEL_FLAG_1_IS_FALSE FLAG_LEFT_BIT(1)  // is NOT free

//=//// LEVEL_FLAG_FORCE_HEAVY_NULLS //////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// If something is a branch and it is evaluating, then it cannot result in
// either a pure null or void result.  So they have to be put in a PACK!.
//
// This is done as a general service of the Trampoline...because if it did
// not, this would require a separate continuation callback to do it.  So
// routines like IF would not be able to just delegate to another level.
//
#define LEVEL_FLAG_FORCE_HEAVY_NULLS \
    FLAG_LEFT_BIT(3)


//=//// LEVEL_FLAG_4_IS_TRUE //////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// !!! Historically levels have identified as being "cells" even though they
// are not, in order to use that flag as a distinction when in bindings
// from the non-cell choices like contexts and paramlists.  This may not be
// the best way to flag levels; alternatives are in consideration.

// the unsurprising flag on the output cell.  This makes the trampoline do it.
//
#define LEVEL_FLAG_FORCE_SURPRISING \

//=//// LEVEL_FLAG_TRAMPOLINE_KEEPALIVE ////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This flag asks the trampoline function to not call Drop_Level() when it
// sees that the level's `executor` has reached the `nullptr` state.  Instead
// it stays on the level stack, and control is passed to the previous level's
// executor (which will then be receiving its level pointer parameter that
// will not be the current top of stack).
//
// It's a feature used by routines which want to make several successive
// requests on a level (REDUCE, ANY, CASE, etc.) without tearing down the
// level and putting it back together again.

//=//// FLAGS 8-15 ARE USED FOR THE "STATE" byte ///////////////////////////=//
//
// One byte's worth is used to encode a "level state" that can be used by
// natives or dispatchers, e.g. to encode which step they are on.
//
// By default, when a level is initialized its state byte will be 0.  This
// lets the executing code know that it's getting control for the first time.

//=//// LEVEL_FLAG_DISPATCHING_INTRINSIC //////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Intrinsics can be run without creating levels for them, if they do not
// use refinements, and if you're not using a debug mode which mandates that
// levels always be created.  In this case there is no Level* to pass to the
// native, so a parent level is passed (which may be a Stepper_Executor(),
// for instance, instead of an Action_Executor())
//
// The parent's OUT can be used, but the macro for getting the argument will
// look for that argument in the SPARE cell.  If the level is being dispatched
// normally, the argument will be in the frame as usual.  A value for the
// action that is currently running will be in SCRATCH.
//
#define LEVEL_FLAG_DISPATCHING_INTRINSIC \

//=//// LEVEL_FLAG_RUNNING_TYPECHECK //////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// This flag was introduced to use with LEVEL_FLAG_DISPATCHING_INTRINSIC, in
// order to deal with the fact that intrinsics are responsible for their own
// argument typechecking...but if they themselves are being run as a typecheck
// then they should not panic() when the types don't pass.  This means they
// should return LOGIC(false) instead of panicing...but if called in a non
// typecheck context they should do the panic.

// This level is the root of a trampoline stack, and hence it cannot be jumped
// past by something like a YIELD, return, or other throw.  This would mean
// crossing C stack levels that the interpreter does not control (e.g. some
// code that called into Rebol as a library.)
//
#define LEVEL_FLAG_ROOT_LEVEL \

//=//// LEVEL_FLAG_UNINTERRUPTIBLE ////////////////////////////////////////=//

// Levels inherit the uninteruptibility flag of their parent when they are
// pushed.  You can clear it after the push if you want an interruptible
// level underneath an uninterruptible one.
//
#define LEVEL_FLAG_UNINTERRUPTIBLE \

// to natives and non-ACTION-executors for miscellaneous purposes.

    // it is available for use by native Dispatchers while they are running.
    // It's particularly useful because it is GC guarded, and a valid target
    // location for evaluations.  (The argument cells of a native are *not*
    // legal evaluation targets...because a debugger that is triggered while
    // a nested level is running might expose intermediate bad states.  The
    // argument cells can be used to hold other fully formed cells.)

    // A second GC-safe cell is available, but with a particular purpose in

    // That can't be the Feed->p cell, because the evaluator has to seek ahead
    // one unit to find lookback quoters, such as `x: default [...]`, where
    // DEFAULT wants to quote the X: to its left.
    //
    // (An attempt was made to optimize this by multiplexing the OUT cell for
    // this purpose...after all, inert items want to wind up in the output cell

    // It may need to be updated.  For instance: if a level gets pushed for

// An arbitrary cell pointer may be returned from a native--in which case it
// will be checked to see if it is thrown and processed if it is, or checked
// to see if it's an unmanaged API handle and released if it is...ultimately
// putting the cell into L->out.
//
// Other special instructions need to be encoded somehow:
//
// * We don't want to use UTF-8 signals like `return "C"` for BOUNCE_CONTINUE.
//   That would miss out on the opportunity to make these equivalent:
//
//       return "panic -[Error]-"
//       return rebDelegate("panic -[Error]-")
//
// * Using a Cell would put us in contention with discerning between legitmate
//   Cells and these signals.
//
// The cleanest choice was deemed to be using the BASE_BYTE_WILD byte, which
// doesn't carry BASE_FLAG_CELL.  We can make simple two byte global pointers
// for the instances, that can be tested via switch() on their bytes or by
// comparison to direct values.
//
// (Performance testing should be done to figure out what techniques are
// faster.  No real A/B testing has been done as of yet.)

// If Eval_Core gets back an REB_R_REDO from a dispatcher, it will re-execute
// the L->phase in the frame.  This function may be changed by the dispatcher
// from what was originally called.
//
// Note it is not safe to let arbitrary user code change values in a
// frame from expected types, and then let those reach an underlying native
// who thought the types had been checked.

// Continuations are used to mitigate the problems that occur when the C stack
// contains a mirror of frames corresponding to the frames for each stack
// level.  Avoiding this means that routines that would be conceived as doing
// a recursion instead return to the evaluator with a new request.  This helps
// avoid crashes from C stack overflows and has many other advantages.  For a
// similar approach and explanation, see:
//
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stackless_Python
//
// What happens is that when a BOUNCE_CONTINUE comes back via the C `return`
// for a native, that native's C stack variables are all gone.  But the heap
// allocated Level stays intact and in the Rebol stack trace.  The native's C
// function will be called back again when the continuation finishes.

// Intrinsic typecheckers want to be able to run in the same Level as an
// action, but not overwrite the ->out cell of the level.  They motivate
// a special state for OKAY so that the L->out can be left as-is.
//
// We don't make this a Wild so it's out of band from "irreducible" bounces,
// e.g. those that can't just resolve to a state in the output cell.
//
// (A direct address is used, so it can signal "Okay" even if the code that
// assigns `okay: ~okay~` hasn't even run yet)

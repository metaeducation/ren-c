        These are words that are used internally by Rebol, which and are
        canonized with small integer SYM_XXX constants.  These constants can
        be quickly used in switch() statements, and a lookup table is on
        hand to turn SYM_XXX integers into the corresponding symbol pointer.

        The reason ordered words are kept in a separate file is that the
        symbol space overlaps with the names of natives and generics that
        are put into lib.  Due to optimizations, this means words where the
        relative order matters need to establish their indexes in lib that
        the natives then must accomodate.

        Unordered words do not forcibly have slots in the optimized range of
        lib, so they are in a separate file.

; === EXTENSIBLE EVALUATION ===
;
; Functions called by the evaluator to interpret types.  Can be redefined
; off the cuff, e.g. local to a function, to change the behavior of fundamental
; types within a scope.

fence!-EVAL  ; e.g. a function that turns {x: 10, y: null} => OBJECT!


; === SEQUENTIAL PARSE3 SYMBOLS FOR SWITCH() ===
;
; An R3-Alpha optimization that we preserve (for now) is that the keywords
; being switch()'d on in PARSE are in a fixed symbol range.  This makes it
; a quick test to tell if something is a parse pre-match or match keyword.
;
; There's also value to having these "packed densely" for the switch statement
; itself, so the compiler can use a jump table.  Try to keep these in order
; and matching the PARSE3 code, for as long as it's relevant (which will
; likely be some time, as UPARSE is going to be too slow for day-to-day
; bootstrapping in the foreseeable future)

; It is convenient to be able to say `for-each [_ x y] [1 2 3 ...] [...]` and
; let the space indicate you are not interested in a value.  This might be
; doable with a generalized "anonymous key" system.  But for now it is assumed
; that all keys have unique symbols.
;
; To get the feature for today, we use some dummy symbols.  They cannot be
; used alongside the actual names `dummy1`, `dummy2`, etc...but rather
; than pick a more esoteric name then `map-each [_ dummy1] ...` is just an
; error.  Using simple names makes the frame more legible.

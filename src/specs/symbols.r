        These are words that are used internally by Rebol, which and are
        canonized with small integer SYM_XXX constants.  These constants can
        be quickly used in switch() statements, and a lookup table is on
        hand to turn SYM_XXX integers into the corresponding symbol pointer.

        If new natives or otherwise are introduced which overlap with the
        names in this list, then the entry in this list must be removed.
        That means there is no ordering contract about the relative values
        of symbols in this file.  See %lib-words.r for that application.

        RUNE! is used to denote items that should already exist.

; Extensions use this for shutdown, when they are explicitly unloaded.

; !!! Plain modules do not have any shutdown mechanism, because they are not

; === EVENT TYPES ===
;
; !!! The event-types list used to be fixed and built into a separate enum.
; Now it is done with Rebol symbols.  Hence, these get uint16_t
; identifiers.  However, symbol numbers are hypothesized to be expandable
; via a pre-published dictionary of strings, committed to as a registry.

; NOTE: The system is not fully booted at this point, so only simple
; expressions are allowed. Anything else will crash the boot.

;-- Standard constants:
zero: 0

;-- Special values:
REBOL: system
sys: system
sys/util: system/contexts/sys
lib: system/contexts/lib

;-- Char constants:
NUL:       #"^(NULL)"
space:     #" "
SP:        space
backspace: #"^(BACK)"
BS:        backspace
tab:       #"^-"
newline:   #"^/"
newpage:   #"^l"
slash:     #"/"
backslash: #"\"
escape:    #"^(ESC)"
CR:        #"^M"
LF:        newline

;-- Function synonyms:
to-logic: :did?
min: :minimum
max: :maximum
abs: :absolute

; Words for BLANK! and bar, for those who don't like symbols

blank: _
bar: '|
~void~: void
~null~: null

; !!! There could be a datatype which evaluated to a null, but there can't
; be a literal type that *is* null.  Currently it's generated by a native.

~: func [
    "Function returning trash result (alternative for `#[trash]`)"
    return: [~]
][
    ;-- Note: actually *faster* than a native, due to Void_Dispatcher()

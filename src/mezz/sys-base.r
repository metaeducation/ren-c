; 1. The console exits to the shell, and hence really only needs the exit code
;    (vs. a script quit that can return any value or error).  It's easier to
;    do the work here than in API strings in the console C code.
;
; 2. Allowing QUIT to run without an argument opens up the possibility of
;    someone putting a QUIT statement in the middle of code and not thinking
;    it takes any arguments, but it picks one up from the next line.  Only
;    the console's QUIT does this--for convenience.  All other places must

  ; 1. We add a QUIT slot to the module (alongside IMPORT* and EXPORT*), and
  ;    fill it in with a custom THROW word to catch it.  MAKE-QUIT gives us a
  ;    function that interprets non-zero integers e.g. (quit 1) as ERROR!
  ;
  ; 2. If there's no explicit QUIT call in the body code, we act as if TRASH!
  ;    was the result.  That's also what MAKE-QUIT has (quit 0) do.
  ;
  ;    !!! We might consider having this run the module's QUIT with 0 instead,
  ;    so that an ADAPT'ed QUIT would always get a quit signal.  But this has
  ;    not been done with RETURN for FUNCTION, so it's a controversial idea.

; DO is aiming to be polymorphic, to run things like JavaScript.  It always
; requires a header (or an implied header from filename/location).  It will
; support blocks at one point, but not in the historical way.
;
;   https://forum.rebol.info/t/polyglot-polymorphic-do/1846
;
; Modern calls for evaluation services on BLOCK! etc. should use EVAL.
;
; For the moment, common features of DO and IMPORT are implemented in the
; IMPORT* command.  This includes:
;
; * Changing the working directory to match the file path (or URL "path") of a
;   script, and restoring the prior path on completion of panic
;
; * Isolating the executed code into a MODULE! so that it doesn't leak into
;   the caller's context.
;
; * Turning @xxx identified script names to DO into a URL by looking it up in
;   the modules library.  So `do @chess` and `import @json` use the same logic
;   to figure out where that name points.
;
; * Setting system.script to reflect the executing script during its run, and
;   then putting it back when control is returned to the caller.
;
; * Adding specialized IMPORT, EXPORT, and INTERN definitions that know where
;   the importing and exporting and interning needs to be done, e.g. into the
;   containing context.  (Lower-level mechanics that want to avoid this should
;   use MAKE MODULE! instead for full control.)
;
; But the actual action taken is different: DO returns the evaluative product
; (scripts must use QUIT/VALUE to return such a product).  While IMPORT returns
; the module context the script was executed in.  Also, IMPORT is designed to
; return the same context every time it is called--so modules are loaded only
; once--while DO performs an action that you can run any number of times.

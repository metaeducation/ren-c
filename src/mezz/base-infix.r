    Purpose: {
        This defines some infix operators.

        See ops.r for how the "weird" words that have to be done through
        a tricky SET manage to have bindings in the lib context, even
        though they aren't picked up here as SET-WORD!.

            (:value) (map-each word reflect :value 'words [to get-word! word])

        ; Note that this is effectively "compiling in" the function as
        ; a direct value, which is kind of interesting...this means that
        ; changing ADD won't change the behavior of +

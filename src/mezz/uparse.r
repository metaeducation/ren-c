        Rebol's PARSE is a tool for performing RegEx-style tasks using an
        English-like dialect.  It permits breaking down complex expressions
        into named subrules, and has a very freeform model for escaping into
        and back out of imperative code:

        http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-15.html
        http://www.codeconscious.com/rebol/parse-tutorial.html
        https://www.red-lang.org/2013/11/041-introducing-parse.html

        The implementation of PARSE engines has traditionally been as
        optimized systems-level code (e.g. C or Red/System), built into the
        interpreter.  This does not offer flexibility to make any minor or
        major changes to the dialect that a user might imagine.

        This script attempts to make PARSE more "hackable", by factoring the
        implementation out so that each keyword or data behavior is handled
        by individual functions.  These functions are stylized so that th
        parse engine can compose these smaller parsers together as part of
        larger processing operations.  This approach is typically called
        "Parser Combinators":

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator

        While this overlaps with typical parser combinators, Rebol's design
        affords it a unique spin.  By building the backbone of the dialect as
        a BLOCK!, there's no SEQUENCE or ALTERNATIVE combinators.  Instead,
        blocks make sequencing implicit just by steps being ordered after one
        another.  The alternates are managed by means of `|` markers, which
        are detected by the implementation of the block combinator--and `|` is
        not a combinator in its own right.  With novel operators and convenient
        ways of switching into imperative processing, it gets a unique and
        literate feel with a relatively clean appearance.

        By making the combinator list passed to UPARSE as a MAP!, is possible
        to easily create overrides or variations of the dialect.  (For
        instance, a version that is compatible with older Rebols.)  But the
        goal is to facilitate even more ambitious features.

    notes: --[
      * This implementation will be *extremely* slow for the foreseeable
        future.  But since it is built on usermode facilities, optimizations
        that are applied to it will bring systemic benefits.  Ultimately the
        goal is to merge this architecture in with the "messier" C code...
        hopefully preserving enough of the hackability while leveraging
        low-level optimizations where possible.

; All combinators receive the INPUT to be processed.  They are also given an
; object representing the STATE of the parse (currently that is just the
; FRAME! of the main UPARSE call which triggered the operation, so any of the
; locals or parameters to that can be accessed, e.g. the list of :COMBINATORS)
;
; The goal of a combinator is to decide whether to match (by returning a
; synthesized value and the updated position in the series) or fail to match
; (by returning an antiform error)
;
; Additional parameters to a combinator are fulfilled by the parse engine by
; looking at the ensuing rules in the rule block.
;
; One of the parameter types that can be given to these functions are another
; parser, to combine them (hence "parser combinator").  So you can take a
; combinator like OPT and parameterize it with SOME which is parameterized
; with "A", to get a composite parser that implements [opt some "a"].
;
; But if a parameter to a combinator is marked as quoted, then that will take
; a value from the callsite literally.
;
; A special COMBINATOR generator is used.  This saves on repetition of
; parameters and also lets the engine get its hooks into the execution of
; parsers...for instance to diagnose the furthest point the parsing reached.
;
; !!! COMBINATOR is used so heavily that having it be usermode makes UPARSE
; prohibitively slow.  The ultimate goal is to have native and usermode
; implementations both exist, with the usermode version being swappable in as
; proof of concept that nothing is being done by the native that the user
; could not have done...just more slowly.
;
; We would like it to be possible to write an "easy" combinator that does not
; do piping of the pending elements, but takes it for granted as coming from
; the success or failure of each parser called in order.  If you formally
; declare a return value for the `pending:` then that means you're going to
; manage it yourself, otherwise it will be automagic.

    === NOT COMBINATOR ===

    ; Historical Redbol PARSE considered NOT a synonym for NOT AHEAD.  But
    ; the concept behind UPARSE's NOT is that some parsers can be "negated",
    ; which allows them to actually advance and consume input:
    ;
    ;     >> parse ["a"] [not ahead integer!, text!]
    ;     == "a"
    ;
    ;     >> parse ["a"] [not integer!]
    ;     == "a"
    ;
    ;     >> parse ["a"] [not some integer!]
    ;     ** Error: SOME combinator cannot be negated with NOT
    ;
    ; The approach has some weaknesses, e.g. the BLOCK! combinator isn't
    ; negatable so `not [integer!]` isn't legal but `not integer!` is.  But
    ; the usefulness is high enough that it's believed worth it.

    === SUBPARSE COMBINATOR ===

    ; Rebol2 had a INTO combinator which only took one argument: a rule to use
    ; when processing the nested input.  There was a popular proposal that
    ; INTO would take a datatype, which would help simplify a common pattern.
    ;
    ;     ahead text! into [some "a"]  ; arity-1 form
    ;     =>
    ;     into text! [some "a"]  ; arity-2 form, from proposals/Topaz
    ;
    ; The belief being that wanting to test the type you were going "INTO" was
    ; needed more often than not, and that at worst it would incentivize adding
    ; the type as a comment.  Neither R3-Alpha nor Red adopted this proposal
    ; (but Topaz did).
    ;
    ; UPARSE reframes this not to take just a datatype, but a "value-bearing
    ; rule".  This means you can use it with generated data that is not
    ; strictly resident in the series, effectively parameterizing it like
    ; PARSE itself...so it's called SUBPARSE:
    ;
    ;     parse "((aaaa)))" [subparse [between some "(" some ")"] [some "a"]]
    ;
    ; Because any value-bearing rule can be used, GROUP! rules are also legal,
    ; which lets you break the rules up for legibility (and avoids interpreting
    ; lists as rules themselves)
    ;
    ;     parse [| | any any any | | |] [
    ;          content: between some '| some '|
    ;          subparse (content) [some 'any]
    ;     ]
    ;
    ; arity-1 INTO may still be useful as a shorthand for SUBPARSE ONE, but
    ; it's also a little bit obtuse when read in context.
    ;
    ; !!! Note: Refinements aren't working as a general mechanic yet, so the
    ; SUBPARSE:RELAX, and SUBPARSE-MATCH:RELAX, etc. have to be handled by
    ; literal combinator specializations added to the map. While :MATCH is
    ; not a refinement on PARSE itself, it's a refinement here for expedience.

    === GATHER AND EMIT ===

    ; With gather, the idea is to do more of a "bubble-up" sort of strategy
    ; for creating objects with labeled fields.  Also, the idea that PARSE
    ; itself would switch modes.
    ;
    ; !!! A particularly interesting concept that has come up is being able
    ; to "USE" or "IMPORT" an OBJECT! so its fields are local (like a WITH).
    ; This could combine with gather, e.g.
    ;
    ;     import parse [1 "hi"] [
    ;         return gather [emit x: integer!, emit y: text!]
    ;     ]
    ;     print [x "is one and" y "is -[hi]-"]
    ;
    ; The idea is interesting enough that it suggests being able to EMIT with
    ; no GATHER in effect, and then have the RETURN GATHER semantic.

    === PINNED! (@XXX) COMBINATORS ===

    ; What the @XXX! combinators are for is doing literal matches vs. a match

    ;
    ;     >> parse [[some "a"] [some "a"]] [some @block]
    ;     == [some "a"]
    ;
    ; However they need to have logic in them to do things like partial string
    ; matches on text.  That logic has to be in the QUOTED! combinator, so
    ; this code builds on that instead of repeating it.
    ;
    ; These follow a simple pattern, could generate at a higher level.
    ;
    ; 1. It would be wasteful to make [@ ...] a synonym for [@[...]], where
    ;    that also means [@ (...)] is a synonym for [@(...)].  Since @var
    ;    means "look up var and match it at this location", a much more
    ;    interesting and common application for the @ sigil is as a synonym
    ;    for the ONE combinator, to mean match anything at the current spot.
    ;
    ; 2. Evaluatively, if we get a quasiform as the lifted it means it was an
    ;    antiform.  Semantically that's matched by the quasiform combinator,
    ;    which treats source-level quasiforms as if they evaluated to their
    ;    antiforms, e.g. (parse [a b a b] [some ~(a b)~]) matches the splice.
    ;
    ; 3. @PATH! might be argued to have the meaning of "run this function
    ;    on the current item and if the result returns okay, then consider it
    ;    a match".  But that is done more cleanly with type constraints e.g.
    ;    `&even?`, which is better than `@/even?` or `@even?/`
    ;
    ; 4. @BLOCK! acting as just matching the block would be redundant with
    ;    quoted block.  So the most "logical" choice is to make it mean
    ;    "literally match the result of running the block as a rule". There
    ;    is not currently an operator that would do that inline, e.g.
    ;    [the some "a"] -> @[some "a"] due to a desire to avoid a combinator
    ;    named THE because of the special arity-0 application of @ as a
    ;    synonym or ONE.  That arity-1 combinator doesn't seem particularly
    ;    necessary, though one could of course make it.

    === NEW-STYLE ANY COMBINATOR ===

    ; Historically ANY was a synonym for what is today TRY SOME FURTHER.  It
    ; was seen as a confusing usage of the word ANY given its typical meaning
    ; related to picking a single item from a list of alternatives--not a
    ; looping construct.
    ;
    ; The new meaning of ANY provides the ability to treat a BLOCK! received
    ; as an argument as a block of alternatives.  This can frequently be more
    ; convenient than trying to build a block of alternatives with `|`, as
    ; that has conditions on the edges where [| ...] is always a no-op as it
    ; means the same thing as [[] | ...], and [... |] will always succeed if
    ; the other alternatives fail because it is the same as [... | []].
    ;
    ; Due to not wanting to handle the block argument as a rule dispatched to
    ; the block combinator, syntax is `any (alternates)` not `any alternates`.

    === BLOCK! COMBINATOR ===

    ; Handling of BLOCK! is the central combinator.  The contents are processed
    ; as a set of alternatives separated by `|`, with a higher-level sequence
    ; operation indicated by `||`.  The bars are treated specially; e.g. | is
    ; not an "OR combinator" due to semantics, because if arguments to all the
    ; steps were captured in one giant ACTION! that would mean changes to
    ; variables by a GROUP! would not be percieved by later steps...since once
    ; a rule like SOME captures a variable it won't see changes:
    ;
    ; https://forum.rebol.info/t/when-should-parse-notice-changes/1528
    ;
    ; (There is also a performance benefit, since if | was a combinator then
    ; a sequence of 100 alternates would have to build a very large OR
    ; function...rather than being able to build a small function for each
    ; step that could short circuit before the others were needed.)

; PARSIFY: The parsify function's job is to produce a single parser that
; encapsulates one "expression" a parse block.  So if you give parsify the
; block `[opt some "a", while ["b"] (print "hi")]` it will give back a
; black-box parsing function that implements the logic of `[opt some "a"]`.
;
;  * The parser takes an INPUT series at a given position as an argument
;  * If it matches, it will give back a synthesized value and a remainder
;  * If it doesn't match, it will return an error
;
; Parsify searches for elements in the combinator map, and it will coordinate
; the connections between those combinators.  However, since combinators are
; not variadic, all the "variadicness" is implemented here in parsify.  A
; datatype combinator (such as that for a TAG!) can thus not acquire any
; arguments unless code is added here to facilitate that.
;
; 1. The concept behind COMMA! is to provide a delimiting between rules.  That
;    is handled by the BLOCK! combinator.  So if you see `[some, "a"]` in
;    PARSIFY, that is just running out of turn.
;
;    (It may seem making a dummy "comma combinator" for the comma type is a
;    good idea.  But that's an unwanted axis of flexibility, and if we defer
;    the error until the combinator is run, it might never be run.)
;
; 2. First thing we do is look up the item in combinators to see if there is a
;    literal match.  This out-prioritizes a more general lookup by type.
;    (Original design was that the type got first dibs, with the concept
;    that it would make it easier to substitute hooked combinators.  But
;    hooking an overriding combinator is kind of a contradiction in terms,
;    it just meant there were dummy combinators for things like TAG! that
;    had to tunnel unknown conventions they did not understand.)
;
; 3. If not a FRAME! combinator, then you can map to an element which will
;    be looked up as if it had been written there literally.  This can be
;    used e.g. to map `<whitespace>` to a rule like `[some whitespace-char]`.
;    Unlike binding, this works for types other than WORD!...and such
;    definitions added to the combinator table are available globally while
;    the parser runs.
;
; 4. If a WORD! looks up to a user-written combinator that takes parser
;    arguments, we have to handle it here instead of being able to fold that
;    into the generic combinator for the WORD! datatype.
;
; 5. UPARSE introduced the idea of "action combinators", where if a PATH!
;    starts with slash, it's considered an invocation of a normal function with
;    the results of combinators as its arguments.  This has to be hacked in
;    variadically here, because the number of arguments needed depends on
;    the number of arguments taken by the action.  For the moment, be weird
;    and customize the combinator with AUGMENT for each argument (parser1,
;    parser2, parser3...)
;
;    (Note that we do fall through to a PATH! combinator for paths that don't
;    end in slashes.  This permits--among other things--the Rebol2 parse
;    semantics to look up variables via PATH!.)
;
; 6. If all else fails, dispatch is given to the datatype.  To reiterate,
;    this kind of dispatch is not variadic.  For that reason, we are stuck
;    on the case of things like dispatch to CHAIN!, because we want `word:`
;    to take an argument while `:(code)` does not.  Hence this hacks up an
;    answer of calling the types *: and :* depending.  Better answer needed.

=== ENTRY POINTS: PARSE*, PARSE ===

; The historical Redbol PARSE was focused on returning a LOGIC! so that you
; could write `if parse data rules [...]` and easily react to finding out if
; the rules matched the input to completion.
;
; But UPARSE goes deeper by letting rules evaluate to arbitrary results, and
; bubbles out the final result.  All values are in-band, so NULL can't be
; drawn out as signals of a lack of completion...definitional errors, and
; hence EXCEPT or RESCUE must be used:
;
;     result: parse data rules except [...]
;
; But PARSE-MATCH is a simple wrapper that returns the input or NULL:
; or it returns null:
;
;     >> parse-match "aaa" [some #a]
;     == "aaa"
;
;     >> parse-match "aaa" [some #b]
;     == ~null~  ; anti
;
; So for those who prefer to use IF to know about a parse's success or failure
; they can just use PARSE-MATCH instead.
;
; There is a core implementation for this called PARSE*, which is exposed
; separately in order to allow handling the case when pending values have
; not been all emitted.  This is utilized by things like the underlining
; EPARSE demo in the web console, where combinators are used to mark ranges
; in the text...but these need to be able to participate in the rollback
; mechanism.  So they are gathered in pending.

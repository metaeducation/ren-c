        This code is evaluated just after actions, natives, sysobj, and
        other lower level definitions. This file intializes a minimal working
        environment that is used for the rest of the boot.
    ]--
    notes: --[
        Any exported SET-WORD!s must be themselves "top level". This hampers
        procedural code here that would like to use tables to avoid repeating
        itself.  This means variadic approaches have to be used that quote
        SET-WORD!s living at the top level, inline after the function call.

; Alternative spellings.
;
; Question mark versions may seem of questionable use--who would say `NOT?`
; instead of just saying `NOT`--but maybe it would add some extra clarity that
; you were getting a logic back.  Also it would allow people to do things
; like redefine NOT locally and still have access to NOT? without having to
; say LIB.NOT ... maybe useful.  Just trying it out.

<: infix lesser?/
>: infix greater?/

; "Official" forms of the comparison operators.  This is what we would use

; have coming from other languages: https://forum.rebol.info/t/349/
;
>=: infix greater-or-equal?/
=<: infix equal-or-lesser?/

; Compatibility Compromise: sacrifice what looks like left and right arrows
; for usage as comparison, even though the perfectly good `=<` winds up
; being unused as a result.  Compromise `=>` just to reinforce what is lost
; by not retraining: https://forum.rebol.info/t/349/11

; CONSTRUCT (arity 2) and HAS (arity 1) have arisen as the OBJECT!-making
; routines, parallel to FUNCTION (arity 2) and DOES (arity 1).  By not being
; nouns like CONTEXT and OBJECT, they free up those words for other usages.
; For legacy support, both CONTEXT and OBJECT are just defined to be HAS.
;
; Note: Historically OBJECT was essentially a synonym for CONTEXT with the
; ability to tolerate a spec of `[a:]` by transforming it to `[a: none].
; The tolerance of ending with a set-word has been added to CONSTRUCT+HAS
; so this distinction is no longer required.
;
context: object: :has


; To be more visually pleasing, properties like LENGTH can be extracted using
; a reflector as simply `length of series`, with no hyphenation.  This is
; because OF quotes the word on the left, and passes it to REFLECT.
;
; There are bootstrap reasons to keep versions like WORDS-OF alive.  Though
; WORDS OF syntax could be faked in R3-Alpha (by making WORDS a function that
; quotes the OF and throws it away, then runs the reflector on the second
; argument), that faking would preclude naming variables "words".
;
; Beyond the bootstrap, there could be other reasons to have hyphenated
; versions.  It could be that performance-critical code would want faster
; processing (a TYPE-OF specialization is slightly faster than TYPE OF, and
; a TYPE-OF native written specifically for the purpose would be even faster).
;
; Also, HELP isn't designed to "see into" reflectors, to get a list of them
; or what they do.  (This problem parallels others like not being able to
; type HELP PARSE and get documentation of the parse dialect...there's no
; link between HELP OF and all the things you could ask about.)  There's also
; no information about specific return types, which could be given here
; with REDESCRIBE.

; In Ren-C, MAKE for OBJECT! does not use the "type" slot for parent

; Also, MAKE OBJECT! does not do evaluation--it is a raw creation,
; and requires a format of a spec block and a body block.

; Because of the commonality of the alternate interpretation of MAKE, this
; bridges until further notice.

; The name FOREVER likely dissuades its use, since many loops aren't intended

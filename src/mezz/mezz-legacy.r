    Description: {
        These definitions turn the clock backward for Rebol code that was
        written prior to Ren/C, e.g. binaries available on rebolsource.net
        or R3-Alpha binaries from rebol.com.  Some flags which are set
        which affect the behavior of natives and the evaluator ARE ONLY
        ENABLED IN DEBUG BUILDS OF REN/C...so be aware of that.

        Some "legacy" definitions (like `foreach` as synonym of `for-each`)
        are kept by default for now, possibly indefinitely.  For other
        changes--such as variations in behavior of natives of the same
        name--you need to add the following to your code:

            do <r3-legacy>

        (Dispatch for this from DO is in the DO* function of sys-base.r)

        This statement will be a NO-OP in older Rebols, since executing a
        tag evaluates to just a tag.  Note that the current trick will
        modify the user context directly, and is not module-based...so
        you really are sort of "backdating" the system globally.  A
        more selective version that turns features on and off one at
        a time to ease porting is needed, perhaps like:

            do/args <r3-legacy> [
                new-do: off
                question-marks: on
            ]

        As always, feedback and improvement welcome.  A porting guide Trello
        has been started at:

; While `foreach` may have been comfortable for some as a word, its hard
; not to see the word `reach` inside of it.  Once you recognize that it's
; not a word and see it with fresh eyes, it looks bad...and also not part
; of the family of other -each functions like `remove-each` and `map-each`.
; The need for the hyphen for `for-each` isn't that bad, but the hyphen
; does break the rhythm a little bit.  `every` was selected as a
; near-synonym of `for-each` (with a different return result).
;
; Because there is no eager need to retake foreach for any other purpose
; and it doesn't convey any fundamentally incorrect idea, it is low on
; the priority list to eliminate completely.  It may be retained as a
; synonym, and `each` may be considered as well.  The support of synonyms
; is controversial and should be balanced against the value of standards.
;
foreach: :for-each


; The distinctions between Rebol's types is important to articulate.
; So using the term "BLOCK" generically to mean any composite
; series--as well as specificially the bracketed block type--is a
; recipe for confusion.
;
; Importantly: it also makes it difficult to get one's bearings
; in the C sources.  It's hard to find where exactly the bits are in
; play that make something a bracketed block...or if that's what you
; are dealing with at all.  Hence some unique name for the typeclass
; is needed.
;
; The search for a new word for the ANY-BLOCK! superclass went on for
; a long time.  LIST! was looking like it might have to be the winner,
; until ARRAY! was deemed more fitting.  The notion that a "Rebol
; Array" contains "Rebol Values" that can be elements of any type
; (including other arrays) separates it from the other series classes
; which can only contain one type of element (codepoints for strings,
; bytes for binaries, numbers for vector).  In the future those may
; have more unification under a typeclass of their own, but ARRAY!
; is for BLOCK!, PAREN!, PATH!, GET-PATH!, SET-PATH!, and LIT-PATH!

any-block!: :any-array!
any-block?: :any-array?


; Similarly to the BLOCK! and ANY-BLOCK! problem for understanding the inside
; and outside of the system, ANY-CONTEXT! is a better name for the superclass
; of OBJECT!, ERROR!, PORT! and (likely to be killed) MODULE!

any-object!: :any-context!
any-object?: :any-object?


; By having typesets prefixed with ANY-*, it helps cement the realization
; on the user's part that they are not dealing with a concrete type...so
; even though this is in the function prototype, they will not get back
; that answer from TYPE-OF, nor could they pass it to MAKE or TO.  Because
; typsets cannot be returned in that way, they're easier than most things
; to make synonyms for the old ANY-less variations.

number!: :any-number!
number?: :any-number?

scalar!: :any-scalar!
scalar?: :any-scalar?

series!: :any-series!

; ANY-TYPE! had an ambiguity in it, which was that with DATATYPE! around
; (possibly being renamed to TYPE! but maybe not) it sounded as if it might
; mean ANY-DATATYPE!--which is more narrow than what it meant to say which
; is "really, any legal Rebol value, type or otherwise".  So ANY-VALUE! is
; the better word for that.  Added for backwards compatibility.
;
any-type!: :any-value!

; !!! BIND? and BOUND? will have to go, but it's not clear exactly if
; BIND-OF or CONTEXT-OF or what is the right term.  So a mass renaming
; effort has not been undertaken, especially given the number of bootstrap
; references.  When the new name final decision comes, then BIND? and BOUND?
; will be the ones with their home in the legacy module...

bind-of: :bound?

; !!! Technically speaking all frames should be "selfless" in the sense that

; In word-space, TRY is very close to ATTEMPT, in having ambiguity about what
; is done with the error if one happens.  It also has historical baggage with
; TRY/CATCH constructs. TRAP does not have that, and better parallels CATCH
; by communicating you seek to "trap errors in this code (with this handler)"
; Here trapping the error suggests you "caught it in a trap" and it is
; in the trap (and hence in your possession) to examine.  /WITH is not only
; shorter than /EXCEPT but it makes much more sense.
;
; !!! This may free up TRY for more interesting uses, such as a much shorter
; word to use for ATTEMPT.  Even so, this is not a priority at this point in
; time...so TRY is left to linger without needing `do <r3-legacy>`

; APPLY is a historically brittle construct, that has been eclipsed by the
; evolution of the evaluator.  An APPLY filling in arguments is positionally
; dependent on the order of the refinements in the function spec, while
; it is now possible to do through alternative mechanisms...e.g. the
; ability to revoke refinement requests via UNSET! and to evaluate refinement
; words via parens or get-words in a PATH!.
;
; Delegating APPLY to "userspace" incurs cost, but there's not really any good
; reason for its existence or usage any longer.  So if it's a little slower,
; that's a good incentive to switch to using the evaluator proper.  It means
; that C code for APPLY does not have to be maintained, which is trickier code
; to read and write than this short function.

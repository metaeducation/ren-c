    Purpose: {
        This specifies error categories and IDs that are given SYM_XXX
        constants and can be evoked using those numbers by C code.

        The errors map to either a TEXT! string, or a BLOCK! with GET-WORD!
        slots showing where argument substitution will go.  Traditionally
        these arguments were named :arg1, :arg2, :arg3...however an idea
        emerging is that error contexts will ultimately use their data
        members to be meaningfully-named arguments for that error ID.

        As a convenience for invoking the errors correctly from C with the
        right number of arguments, see the Error_Xxx_Yyy_Raw() functions
        auto-generated by %make-boot.r.

        Because error callsites only name the ID and category of the error,
        the messages are stored in an "errors catalog".  For this reason,
        standard errors evoked from usermode as well as C are found here.

        !!! TBD: method of extending the error catalog and managing the
        ecology of identity of new errors (possibly via URL uniqueness).

        !!! TBD: method of cleaning up errors not referenced from the code.

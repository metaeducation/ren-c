// Most text strings in Rebol should appear in the bootstrap files as Rebol
// code.  This allows for "internationalization" without needing to update
// the C code.  Other advantages are that the strings are compressed,
// "reduces tampering", etc.
//
// So to keep track of any stray English strings in the executable which make
// it into the user's view, they should be located here.
//
// NOTE: It's acceptable for hardcoded English strings to appear in the debug
// build or in other debug settings, as anyone working with the C code itself
// is basically expected to be able to read English (given the variable names
// and comments in the C are English).
//
// NOTE: For a constant to be picked up from this file, the parse rule is
// that it !!HAS TO START WITH `const`!!.  It makes the extern definition
// based on what it captures up to the `=` sign.
